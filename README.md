Dependencies fetch via simple-maven
===================================

This is simple possible ant script that could be used to fetch 
maven dependencies in Intellij IDEA based projects.

Call ```fetch.xml``` to fetch all missing dependencies

The script also updates IDEA library files to include new-ly added libraries to IDEA project.
It's expected you'll no changed files on script re-run. If you do => post the issue with diff 

We use  [Maven Ant Tasks](http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/examples/dependencies.html)
inside. So `<dependency>` element under `<maven-fetch>` is the same
element as under Maven Ant Tasks
